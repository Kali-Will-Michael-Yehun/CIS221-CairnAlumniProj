# CIS221-CairnAlumniProj
A Sample project for Cairn University's CIS-221 Spring 2021 class. Modeling a potential Alumni Relations database.

All initial work was done together in a group over zoom, with Kali taking lead on diagraming and communication while Yehun helped plan the database structure. Michael used the diagram to begin work on the initial tables in sql and Will focused on helping the group understand the logic involved with LinkedIn and how that could translate to Database information. 

After the table structure had been settled the remaining tasks were distributed accordingly for completion:
Will: Degrees Table
Yehun: GuestSpeakers Table
Michael: Alum & Careers Tables
Kali: Comments Table, file assembly

Each member completed their own INSERT Statements File and committed it to the repository.
